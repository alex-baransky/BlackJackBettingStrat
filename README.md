# BlackJackBettingStrat
A Python script to simulate and test different betting strategies to play in Blackjack.

This script consists of multiple classes to represent different objects in the game of Blackjack.

## Objective
To run a simulation to approximate the return when using different Blackjack betting strategies. I will start with the D'Alembert stratgey and add functionality to try the 2-1-2 strategy and hopefully more.
